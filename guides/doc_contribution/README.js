Ext.data.JsonP.doc_contribution({"guide":"<h2>Contributing to the Docs</h2>\n\n<p>TideSDK is a very huge and sophisticated project. The old Titanium Desktop docs were a bit outdated and were missing a lot of information and examples.</p>\n\n<p>We want to change that with the TideSDK docs: Providing examples whenever its possible and many, many guides (like tutorials) to make it easy for the TideSDK users to create cool desktop applications.</p>\n\n<h3>Preparation</h3>\n\n<p>In order to make changes on the TideSDK User docs, you need to have a github account and fork <a href=\"https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK-User-Docs\">our documentation project</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After you made your changes, commit them to your fork and send us a pull request.</p>\n\n<p>Its always a good decision to drop by in our IRC channel <a href=\"irc://chat.freenode.net#tidesdk\">#tidesdk @ freenode.net</a> and talk to us first, if you want to write a new guide or example.</p>\n\n<h3>Working with the API docs</h3>\n\n<p>The exposed TideSDK API is documented in a couple of JavaScript skeleton files (only function definitions with empty bodies).  <br/>\nThose JavaScript files are parsed by JSduck and create the structure of our API documentation.</p>\n\n<p>A doctag to a function should always be structured like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n* The block starts with a description of the functon/method/object you want to document.\n*\n* @class Ti.Module.Name\n* @member Ti.Module\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The @class tag gets the full path to the object you want to document, including the object name itself.\nThe @member tag gets the full path to the parent object of the object you want to document.</p>\n\n<p>You should read the <a href=\"https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck/wiki\">JSduck documentation</a> on github.</p>\n\n<h3>Writing a guide</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to provide more advanced information in tutorial form, then the guides section is the right choice for you.  <br/>\nWe aim to create guides in every important section of the TideSDK API to help users with every feature of the SDK.</p>\n\n<p>After you have forked the doc project, have a look into the folder /source/guides/  <br/>\nEvery single guide gets its own, unique folder where the folder name acts like a key for the guide.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look into one or more existing guide folders to learn about how they are structured.  <br/>\nIn a nutshell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Everything that belongs to the guide must be stored in the guide folder you created</li>\n<li>The text of the guide is in [markdown format] and has to be stored inside a <code>README.md</code> file.</li>\n<li>If you want to use a thumbnail for your guide, place a <code>icon.png</code> file with the dimensions 114px x 86px inside your guide folder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>After you have written the guide, you have to add it to the list of existing guides.  <br/>\nOpen the file /source/guides.json and add your created guide to some section where it belongs to.  <br/>\nIf you are not sure, or would need to create a new section, talk to us on IRC, first.</p>\n","title":"Contributing to the documentation"});
